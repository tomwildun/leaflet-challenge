Module 15 Challenge

Findings:

Through on analysis of M2.5+ earthquakes over a 7 days, I was able to identify a multitude of earthquakes all over the country. Surprisingly, most earthquakes within the past 7 days all occured on the west coast with a high concentration of earthquakes in Alaska. It was interesting to see that there was an earthquake just outside of San Antonio! Very interesting challenge that helped familiarize me with GeoJSON API using d3.
